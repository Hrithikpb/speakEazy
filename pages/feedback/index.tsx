            Here's some pacing feedback. 
            <ol>
                <li>Introduction Speed: Your introduction was slightly rushed. Slowing down here can help you establish a connection with the audience right from the start. Take a deep breath before you begin and pace yourself.</li>
                <li>Transition Points: Some of the transitions between your key points were a bit fast. Pausing slightly longer at these points can give your audience time to absorb what you just said and prepare for the next idea.</li>
                <li>Emphasis Pauses: Adding more strategic pauses after important statements would enhance their impact. For example, after delivering a key statistic or a crucial piece of information, pause for a moment to let it sink in.</li>
                <li>Ending Pace: The conclusion felt rushed, as if you were eager to finish. Slowing down and summarizing your key points calmly can leave a lasting impression and give your speech a strong finish.</li>
            </ol>
